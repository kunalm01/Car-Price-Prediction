seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn


## Code
The car_price_prediction.ipynb notebook contains the code for this project. The main steps of the code are as follows:

1. Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset
2. Exploratory data analysis to understand the features and their distributions
3. Data preprocessing to remove unnecessary features and handle missing values
4. Feature engineering to create new features from existing ones
5. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
6. Building multiple regression models and evaluating their performance using R-squared metric
7. Selecting the best performing model and predicting the car prices on the testing set


## How to use
To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the car_price_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You can run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the results.
